# personal_website

Goal of this project is to allow registered user to have their own shareable personal website, even with no programming and designing experience

Initially forget to change default name(git config) due to just change laptop, now it is set to the correct account, which is Feng-12138. 

Both Sam Sun and Feng-12138 is me

Will have 2 frontend websites(one requires authorization, one not), with one shared backend system

All works and designs currently are done by Yiran Sun(as the only person in his studio 20-Feng-40 studio)
